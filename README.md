## About the project

This project contains a visual recreation of the Mandelbrot and Julia fractals. Both fractals are generated by applying complex formulas that calculate whether or not a point belongs to a set, depending on the number of iterations needed to diverge or stay on a boundary.

      The Julia set is similar to the Mandelbrot set but depends on a specific constant. This allows us to observe unique variations of the fractals depending on the value of that constant, generating diverse and equally complex patterns.<br>

     The Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating a complex quadratic function over each point in the complex plane and checking its divergence. Points that do not diverge remain in the set, forming a structure with an intricate and infinite edge.<br>

## How to use

To compile and run the project on Linux, make sure you have the following dependencies installed, which are required for **MiniLibX**:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xorg libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libbsd-dev
```
Once the dependencies have been installed, run the following command with the available options that will appear:
```bash
make && ./fractol julia -0.768 0.183
```

After this, you can enjoy the infinite effect of the fractals and change the colours. Have fun ! 🙃
